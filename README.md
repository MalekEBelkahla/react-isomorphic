# Isomorphic React

Use as much of the same code base as possible to render both on the client and the server.

Try turning off JavaScript in your browser and navigate around.

## Usage

```zsh
npm install
npm run build
# or `npm run watch`
node server.js
```

## Todo

* Investigate if [pjax](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax) is a good fit for this use case.
